- Hi, I’m @Finn-Ko, but just call me Finn
- I'm studying computer science and I like to play basketball.
- Currently I'm learning C/C++, Spring framework for Java, node.js, typescript and anything interesting that catches my eye.
- Outside of Uni I'm working on a multiplayer geography game based on node.js.
